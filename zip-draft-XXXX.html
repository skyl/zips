            <p>This ZIP proposes the allocation of 50% of the Zcash block reward, post-November 2024 halving, to a decentralized "lockbox." Currently, 80% of the block reward goes to miners, while 20% is distributed among the Major Grants Fund, Electric Coin Company (ECC), and the Zcash Foundation (ZF). If no changes are made, this 20% dev fund will expire, resulting in the entire block reward going to miners, leaving no block-reward funds for essential protocol development, security, marketing, or legal expenses.</p>
            <p>The proposed lockbox addresses significant issues observed with <a id="footnote-reference-2" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-1014">2</a>, such as regulatory risks, inefficiencies in funding organizations instead of projects, tax compliance inefficiencies, and centralization. By disbursing funds through a decentralized mechanism, resembling a DAO, this ZIP aims to ensure community involvement and efficient, project-specific funding. This approach is intended to improve regulatory compliance, reduce inefficiencies, simplify tax compliance, and enhance the decentralization of Zcash's funding structure.</p>

            <p>As of now, the Zcash block reward is allocated with 80% going to miners, and the remaining 20% distributed among the Major Grants Fund (8%), Electric Coin Company (ECC) (7%), and the Zcash Foundation (ZF) (5%). This funding structure supports various essential activities such as protocol development, security, marketing, and legal expenses. However, this model will expire in November 2024, leading to the entire block reward being allocated to miners if no changes are made. This expiration poses several significant issues:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>Regulatory Risks</strong>: The current model, as observed with ZIP-1014, involves direct funding of US-based organizations. This can potentially attract regulatory scrutiny from entities such as the SEC, posing legal risks to the Zcash ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Funding Inefficiencies</strong>: Directly funding organizations rather than specific projects leads to inefficiencies. Organizations may accumulate excess funds while specific projects may not receive adequate resources. A more granular approach, funding projects directly, would be more efficient.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Compliance Complications</strong>: The current model introduces tax inefficiencies, as 501(c)(3) organizations must treat received block rewards as income, leading to significant tax liabilities. This requires selling some of the block rewards to cover these taxes, which is financially inefficient.</li>
                <li><strong>Centralization Concerns</strong>: The existing funding model centralizes decision-making power within a few organizations, which contradicts the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. Traditional organizational structures with boards and executives introduce a single point of failure and limit community involvement in funding decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Involvement</strong>: The current system provides minimal formal input from the community regarding what projects should be funded. This lack of community involvement can lead to misalignment between funded projects and community priorities.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Given these issues, this ZIP proposes the creation of a decentralized "lockbox" to which 50% of the Zcash block reward will be allocated post-November 2024 halving. The funds in this lockbox will only be disbursed through a decentralized mechanism resembling a DAO. This new approach aims to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce regulatory risks by avoiding direct funding of specific organizations.</li>
                <li>Improve funding efficiency by allocating resources directly to projects rather than organizations.</li>
                <li>Simplify tax compliance by allowing recipients to handle tax liabilities according to their circumstances. - Enhance decentralization by distributing decision-making power and ensuring community involvement in funding decisions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By addressing these issues, this proposal aims to ensure sustainable, efficient, and decentralized funding for essential activities within the Zcash ecosystem.</p>

            <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>Decentralized Funding Mechanism</strong>: The new funding model must implement a decentralized mechanism for disbursing funds. This mechanism should resemble a DAO, ensuring that the community has a direct say in funding decisions. This is crucial to avoid centralization and ensure transparency and fairness in the allocation of resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance</strong>: The proposed funding model must be designed to minimize regulatory risks. This involves avoiding direct funding of US-based organizations to prevent potential scrutiny from regulatory bodies such as the SEC. The mechanism should comply with applicable laws and regulations to ensure the long-term sustainability of the funding model.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency in Funding Allocation</strong>: The new model should focus on funding specific projects rather than organizations. This approach aims to ensure that resources are utilized efficiently and that projects receive the necessary support without accumulating excess funds in organizations.</li>
                <li><strong>Simplified Tax Compliance</strong>: The funding mechanism must simplify tax compliance for recipients. This can be achieved by deferring tax liabilities to the recipients, allowing them to handle taxes according to their circumstances, thus avoiding the need for organizations to sell block rewards to cover taxes.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Involvement</strong>: The funding model must enhance community involvement in decision-making processes. This includes mechanisms for the community to propose, discuss, and vote on projects that should receive funding. Ensuring broad community participation is key to aligning funded projects with the community's priorities.</li>
                <li><strong>Security of Funds</strong>: The mechanism for storing and disbursing funds must be secure. This includes protecting against key compromise, ensuring the integrity of the decentralized voting/signature mechanism, and implementing robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of funds.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility and Adaptability</strong>: The new funding model should be flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances. This involves creating a system that can evolve based on feedback and new developments in the Zcash ecosystem, ensuring it remains relevant and effective over time.</li>

            <p>The Specification section describes what should change, using precise language and conformance key words. Anything that is <em>required in order to implement the ZIP</em> (or follow its process, in the case of a Process ZIP) should be in this section.</p>
            <p>Avoid overspecification! Also avoid underspecification. Specification is hard. Don't be afraid to ask for help.</p>
            <p>Feel free to copy from other ZIPs doing similar things, e.g. defining RPC calls, consensus rules, etc.</p>
            <p>ZIPs MUST take into account differences between the Zcash Mainnet and Testnet <a id="footnote-reference-3" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-networks">6</a> where applicable. A consensus ZIP MUST be able to be deployed on both Mainnet and Testnet.</p>
            <p>Unless the specification is particularly simple, you will need to organise it under subheadings.</p>

                <p>Like RFCs, ZIPs are precise technical documents that SHOULD give enough implementation information to implement part of a Zcash-related protocol or follow a Zcash-related process.</p>
                <p>ZIPs are different from RFCs in the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many (but not all) ZIPs are "living documents"; they are updated in-place as the relevant areas of the protocol or process change. Unlike in the RFC process, making a change in an area described by a published ZIP does not <em>necessarily</em> require creating a new ZIP, although that is an option if the change is extensive enough to warrant it.</li>
                    <li>The expected structure of a ZIP is more constrained than an RFC. For example, the Specification section is REQUIRED, and all of the conformance requirements MUST go in that section. The ZIP editors will help you to ensure that things go in the right sections.</li>
                    <li>Security considerations SHOULD be spread throughout the text, in the places where they are most relevant.</li>

                <p>In general the conventions in the Zcash protocol specification SHOULD be followed. If you find this difficult, don't worry too much about it in initial drafts; the ZIP editors will catch any inconsistencies in review.</p>
