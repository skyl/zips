            <p>This ZIP proposes the allocation of 50% of the Zcash block reward, post-November 2024 halving, to an in-protocol "lockbox." Currently, 80% of the block reward goes to miners, while 20% is distributed among the Major Grants Fund (ZCG), Electric Coin Company (ECC), and the Zcash Foundation (ZF). If no changes are made, this 20% dev fund will expire, resulting in the entire block reward going to miners, leaving no block-reward funds for essential protocol development, security, marketing, or legal expenses.</p>
            <p>The proposed lockbox addresses significant issues observed with <a id="footnote-reference-2" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-1014">2</a>, such as regulatory risks, inefficiencies in funding organizations instead of projects, and centralization. While the exact disbursement mechanism for the lockbox funds is yet to be determined and will be addressed in a future ZIP, the goal is to employ a decentralized mechanism resembling a DAO, ensuring community involvement and efficient, project-specific funding. This approach is intended to potentially improve regulatory compliance, reduce inefficiencies, and enhance the decentralization of Zcash's funding structure.</p>

            <p>As of now, the Zcash block reward is allocated with 80% going to miners, and the remaining 20% distributed among the Major Grants Fund (8%), Electric Coin Company (ECC) (7%), and the Zcash Foundation (ZF) (5%). This funding structure supports various essential activities such as protocol development, security, marketing, and legal expenses. However, this model will expire in November 2024, leading to the entire block reward being allocated to miners if no changes are made. This expiration poses several significant issues:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>Regulatory Risks</strong>: The current model, as observed with ZIP-1014, involves direct funding of US-based organizations. This can potentially attract regulatory scrutiny from entities such as the SEC, posing legal risks to the Zcash ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Funding Inefficiencies</strong>: Directly funding organizations rather than specific projects leads to inefficiencies. Organizations may accumulate excess funds while specific projects may not receive adequate resources. A more granular approach, funding projects directly, would be more efficient.</li>
                <li><strong>Centralization Concerns</strong>: The existing funding model centralizes decision-making power within a few organizations, which contradicts the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. Traditional organizational structures with boards and executives introduce a single point of failure and limit community involvement in funding decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Involvement</strong>: The current system provides minimal formal input from the community regarding what projects should be funded. This lack of community involvement can lead to misalignment between funded projects and community priorities.</li>
                <li><strong>Potential Tax Efficiency</strong>: By potentially deferring taxable events until the liquidation of funds by recipients, the proposed lockbox mechanism could allow for more flexibility in handling tax liabilities. This approach could reduce the need for immediate liquidation and improve the overall use of block reward resources compared to directly funding US-based organizations with a USD bottom line.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Given these issues, this ZIP proposes the creation of a decentralized "lockbox" to which 50% of the Zcash block reward will be allocated post-November 2024 halving. The exact disbursement mechanism for the lockbox funds will be determined in a future ZIP, but the goal is to ensure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced regulatory risks by avoiding direct funding of specific organizations.</li>
                <li>Improved funding efficiency by allocating resources directly to projects rather than organizations.</li>
                <li>Enhanced decentralization by distributing decision-making power and ensuring community involvement in funding decisions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By addressing these issues, this proposal aims to ensure sustainable, efficient, and decentralized funding for essential activities within the Zcash ecosystem.</p>

            <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>In-Protocol Lockbox Creation</strong>: The ZIP must define the creation of an in-protocol lockbox where 50% of the Zcash block reward will be allocated post-November 2024 halving. This lockbox will securely store funds until a disbursement mechanism is established in a future ZIP.</li>
                <li><strong>Decentralization Goal</strong>: The lockbox must be designed with the goal of future decentralization in mind. While the disbursement mechanism will be defined later, the lockbox should support the principles of decentralization to ensure future community involvement and project-specific funding.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Considerations</strong>: The creation of the lockbox should minimize regulatory risks by avoiding direct funding of specific organizations. The design should ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations to support the long-term sustainability of the funding model.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient Allocation Preparation</strong>: The lockbox must be prepared to allocate resources efficiently once the disbursement mechanism is defined. This includes ensuring that funds are readily available for future projects and not tied up in organizational overhead.</li>
                <li><strong>Potential Tax Efficiency</strong>: The lockbox should be designed with the potential to defer taxable events until the liquidation of funds by recipients, allowing for more flexibility in handling tax liabilities compared to direct funding of US-based organizations.</li>
                <li><strong>Security of Funds</strong>: The lockbox must implement robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access or misuse of funds. This includes ensuring the integrity of the future decentralized voting/signature mechanism.</li>
                <li><strong>Future Adaptability</strong>: The lockbox design should be flexible and adaptable to accommodate the disbursement mechanism defined in a future ZIP. This ensures that the system can evolve based on feedback and new developments in the Zcash ecosystem.</li>

            <p>This ZIP specifically addresses the creation of an in-protocol "lockbox" for accumulating a portion of the Zcash block reward post-November 2024 halving. The following aspects are explicitly deferred to future ZIPs and are not covered by this proposal:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>Disbursement Mechanism</strong>: The exact method for disbursing the accumulated funds from the lockbox is not defined in this ZIP. The design, implementation, and governance of the disbursement mechanism will be addressed in a future ZIP. This includes specifics on how funds will be allocated, the voting or decision-making process, and the structure of the decentralized mechanism (such as a DAO).</li>
                <li><strong>Specific Allocation Percentages</strong>: While this ZIP proposes the allocation of 50% of the block reward to the lockbox, it does not prescribe the detailed percentages for various funding categories or the specific amounts that will be distributed to different projects or entities.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance Details</strong>: The proposal outlines the potential to reduce regulatory risks by avoiding direct funding of US-based organizations, but it does not detail specific regulatory compliance strategies. Future ZIPs will need to address how the disbursement mechanism complies with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Implementation</strong>: The technical specifics of how the lockbox will be integrated into the Zcash protocol, including any necessary changes to the codebase and the precise methods for ensuring security and transparency, are not covered in this ZIP. These details will be provided in subsequent proposals and technical documentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Taxation Strategy</strong>: Although the potential for improved tax efficiency is mentioned, this ZIP does not provide a detailed strategy for managing tax liabilities. Future ZIPs will explore the implications of tax compliance and the best methods for handling taxable events related to the disbursement of funds.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact Assessment</strong>: The long-term impact of reallocating a portion of the block reward to the lockbox on the Zcash ecosystem, including its effect on miners, developers, and the broader community, is not analyzed in this ZIP. Subsequent proposals will need to evaluate the outcomes and make necessary adjustments based on real-world feedback and data.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>By focusing on the establishment of the lockbox, this ZIP aims to lay the groundwork for a more decentralized and efficient funding mechanism. The deferred issues will be crucial in shaping the final implementation and ensuring the proposed system's success and sustainability.</p>

            <p>The Specification section describes what should change, using precise language and conformance key words. Anything that is <em>required in order to implement the ZIP</em> (or follow its process, in the case of a Process ZIP) should be in this section.</p>

            <p>Feel free to copy from other ZIPs doing similar things, e.g. defining RPC calls, consensus rules, etc.</p>
            <p>ZIPs MUST take into account differences between the Zcash Mainnet and Testnet <a id="footnote-reference-3" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-networks">6</a> where applicable. A consensus ZIP MUST be able to be deployed on both Mainnet and Testnet.</p>
            <p>Unless the specification is particularly simple, you will need to organise it under subheadings.</p>

                <p>Like RFCs, ZIPs are precise technical documents that SHOULD give enough implementation information to implement part of a Zcash-related protocol or follow a Zcash-related process.</p>
                <p>ZIPs are different from RFCs in the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many (but not all) ZIPs are "living documents"; they are updated in-place as the relevant areas of the protocol or process change. Unlike in the RFC process, making a change in an area described by a published ZIP does not <em>necessarily</em> require creating a new ZIP, although that is an option if the change is extensive enough to warrant it.</li>
                    <li>The expected structure of a ZIP is more constrained than an RFC. For example, the Specification section is REQUIRED, and all of the conformance requirements MUST go in that section. The ZIP editors will help you to ensure that things go in the right sections.</li>
                    <li>Security considerations SHOULD be spread throughout the text, in the places where they are most relevant.</li>
