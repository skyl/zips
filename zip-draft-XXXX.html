        <section id="abstract"><h2><span class="section-heading">Abstract</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#abstract"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h2>
            <p>This ZIP proposes the allocation of 50% of the Zcash block reward, post-November 2024 halving, to a decentralized "lockbox." Currently, 80% of the block reward goes to miners, while 20% is distributed among the Major Grants Fund, Electric Coin Company (ECC), and the Zcash Foundation (ZF). If no changes are made, this 20% dev fund will expire, resulting in the entire block reward going to miners, leaving no block-reward funds for essential protocol development, security, marketing, or legal expenses.</p>
            <p>The proposed lockbox addresses significant issues observed with <a id="footnote-reference-2" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-1014">2</a>, such as regulatory risks, inefficiencies in funding organizations instead of projects, tax compliance inefficiencies, and centralization. By disbursing funds through a decentralized mechanism, resembling a DAO, this ZIP aims to ensure community involvement and efficient, project-specific funding. This approach is intended to improve regulatory compliance, reduce inefficiencies, simplify tax compliance, and enhance the decentralization of Zcash's funding structure.</p>

            <p>{Why is this proposal needed?</p>
            <p>This is one of the most important sections of the ZIP, and should be detailed and comprehensive. It shouldn't include any of the actual specification -- don't put conformance requirements in this section.</p>
            <p>Explain the status quo, why the status quo is in need of improvement, and if applicable, the history of how this area has changed. Then describe <em>at a high level</em> why this proposed solution addresses the perceived issues. It is ok if this is somewhat redundant with the abstract, but here you can go into a lot more detail.}</p>
        </section>
        <section id="requirements"><h2><span class="section-heading">Requirements</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#requirements"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h2>
            <p>{Describe design constraints on, or goals for the solution -- typically one paragraph for each constraint or goal. Again, don't actually specify anything here; this section is primarily for use as a consistency check that what is specified meets the requirements.}</p>
        </section>
        <section id="non-requirements"><h2><span class="section-heading">Non-requirements</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#non-requirements"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h2>
            <p>{This section is entirely optional. If it is present, it describes issues that the proposal is <em>not</em> attempting to address, that someone might otherwise think it does or should.}</p>
        </section>
        <section id="specification"><h2><span class="section-heading">Specification</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#specification"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h2>
            <p>{Replace this entire section.}</p>
            <p>The Specification section describes what should change, using precise language and conformance key words. Anything that is <em>required in order to implement the ZIP</em> (or follow its process, in the case of a Process ZIP) should be in this section.</p>
            <p>Avoid overspecification! Also avoid underspecification. Specification is hard. Don't be afraid to ask for help.</p>
            <p>Feel free to copy from other ZIPs doing similar things, e.g. defining RPC calls, consensus rules, etc.</p>
            <p>ZIPs MUST take into account differences between the Zcash Mainnet and Testnet <a id="footnote-reference-3" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-networks">6</a> where applicable. A consensus ZIP MUST be able to be deployed on both Mainnet and Testnet.</p>
            <p>Unless the specification is particularly simple, you will need to organise it under subheadings.</p>
            <section id="example-subheading"><h3><span class="section-heading">Example subheading</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#example-subheading"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h3>
                <p>At least while the ZIP is in Draft, we encourage writing open questions and TODOs.</p>
                <section id="open-questions"><h4><span class="section-heading">Open questions</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#open-questions"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h4>

                <p>Like RFCs, ZIPs are precise technical documents that SHOULD give enough implementation information to implement part of a Zcash-related protocol or follow a Zcash-related process.</p>
                <p>ZIPs are different from RFCs in the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many (but not all) ZIPs are "living documents"; they are updated in-place as the relevant areas of the protocol or process change. Unlike in the RFC process, making a change in an area described by a published ZIP does not <em>necessarily</em> require creating a new ZIP, although that is an option if the change is extensive enough to warrant it.</li>
                    <li>The expected structure of a ZIP is more constrained than an RFC. For example, the Specification section is REQUIRED, and all of the conformance requirements MUST go in that section. The ZIP editors will help you to ensure that things go in the right sections.</li>
                    <li>Security considerations SHOULD be spread throughout the text, in the places where they are most relevant.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Embedded
                    <span class="math">\(\LaTeX\)</span>
                 is allowed and encouraged in ZIPs. The syntax for inline math is "<code>:math:`latex code`</code>" in reStructuredText or "<code>$latex code$</code>" in Markdown. The rendered HTML will use KaTeX <a id="footnote-reference-4" class="footnote_reference" href="#katex">7</a>, which only supports a subset of
                    <span class="math">\(\LaTeX\!\)</span>
                , so you will need to double-check that the rendering is as intended.</p>
                <p>In general the conventions in the Zcash protocol specification SHOULD be followed. If you find this difficult, don't worry too much about it in initial drafts; the ZIP editors will catch any inconsistencies in review.</p>

                <aside class="note">
                    <p>"<code>.. note::</code>" in reStructuredText, or "<code>:::info</code>" (terminated by "<code>:::</code>") in Markdown, can be used for an aside from the main text.</p>
                    <p>The rendering of notes is colourful and may be distracting, so they should only be used for important points.</p>
                </aside>

                    <p>"<code>.. warning::</code>" in reStructuredText, or "<code>:::warning</code>" (terminated by "<code>:::</code>") in Markdown, can be used for warnings.</p>
                    <p>Warnings should be used very sparingly — for example to signal that a entire specification, or part of it, may be inapplicable or could cause significant interoperability or security problems. In most cases, a "MUST" or "SHOULD" conformance requirement is more appropriate.</p>

                <p>For references to the Zcash protocol specification, prefer to link to a section anchor, and name the reference as <code>[#protocol-&lt;anchor&gt;]</code>. This makes it more likely that the link will remain valid if sections are renumbered or if content is moved. The anchors in the protocol specification can be displayed by clicking on a section heading in most PDF viewers. References to particular sections should be versioned, even though the link will point to the most recent stable version.</p>
                <p>Do not include the "<code>https://zips.z.cash/</code>" part of URLs to ZIPs or the protocol spec.</p>
